-- Read model for the admin audit-log page: one row per audited write, enriched
-- with the previous snapshot of the record (UPDATE only) and the columns that changed.
--
-- Filtering the view by tstamp is pushed down into log.history, so the LATERAL
-- lookups (idx_history_lookup) only run for the rows that survive the filters.
--
-- record/previous hold raw snapshots, including hashes and secrets. They are
-- for the service layer only, which redacts them (see src/middlewares/mappers/audit).
